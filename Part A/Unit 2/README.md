## 5. Write a program for simple RSA algorithm to encrypt and decrypt the data.

## 6. Write a program for congestion control using leaky bucket algorithm.

```
1. Start
2. Set the bucket size or the buffer size.
3. Set the output rate.
4. Transmit the packets such that there is no overflow.
5. Repeat the process of transmission until all packets are transmitted. (Reject packets where its size is greater than the bucket size)
6. Stop
```
